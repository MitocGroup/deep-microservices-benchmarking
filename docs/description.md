deep-microservices-benchmarking is a microservice designed to help benchmark web applications built
on top of [DEEP Framework](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework). It could be used either
as a standalone application or as a dependency in other deep-microservices. This repository is open
sourced to show case how developers can build and deploy hassle-free cloud-native web applications
using microservices architecture and serverless computing.
